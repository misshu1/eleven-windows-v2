                    A cookie is a small amount of information that’s downloaded
                    to your computer or device when you visit our Site. We use a
                    number of different cookies, including functional,
                    performance, advertising, and social media or content
                    cookies. Cookies make your browsing experience better by
                    allowing the website to remember your actions and
                    preferences (such as login and region selection). This means
                    you don’t have to re-enter this information each time you
                    return to the site or browse from one page to another.
                    Cookies also provide information on how people use the
                    website, for instance whether it’s their first time visiting
                    or if they are a frequent visitor.

                    We use the following cookies to optimize your experience on
                    our Site and to provide our services.

                <h2>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
                <p>
                    This site may use various technologies to collect and store
                    information when you visit the Site including cookies or
                    similar technologies to identify your browser or device. By
                    using the Site, you consent to the use of such
                    technologies.

                    The length of time that a cookie remains on your computer or
                    mobile device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or
                    “session” cookie. Session cookies last until you stop
                    browsing and persistent cookies last until they expire or
                    are deleted. Most of the cookies we use are persistent and
                    will expire between 30 minutes and two years from the date
                    they are downloaded to your device.

                <p>
                    You can control and manage cookies in various ways. Please
                    keep in mind that removing or blocking cookies can
                    negatively impact your user experience and parts of our
                    website may no longer be fully accessible.
